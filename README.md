# FsParserCombinators

This project contains code for a series of blog posts called [Understanding Parser Combinators](http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/understanding-parser-combinators/).
A lot of the code is straight out of the blog posts.

I have added unit tests.

The project was written in F# using VS2013.
